									<h1>Myself Rohan Dange</h1>
									<p>A senior, currently enrolled in Illinois Institute of Technology completing Master's in Data Analytics & Management.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Rohan.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I am passionate about programming and data, as well as sports in general. Soccer is my favorite sport, and I've been a Cristiano Ronaldo and Real Madrid fan since I can remember. I played professional soccer for the most of my adolescence, which increased my appreciation for the sport. This experience also taught me how to operate effectively and efficiently as part of a team.</p>
								<p>As a dedicated and driven professional in the field of Data Analytics and Data Science, I bring a wealth of experience and expertise to the table. With a Master's in Data Analytics & Management from the Illinois Institute of Technology, I have a solid foundation in data mining, machine learning, and database management. During my tenure as a Data Analyst Intern at GlobalShala Pvt Ltd., I utilized exploratory data analysis to uncover meaningful insights and built machine learning models in Python (TensorFlow) to predict user behavior. Additionally, I developed complex Tableau dashboards for both technical and business users. As a Software Engineer at DXC Technology, I excelled in SQL, JavaScript, and React.js, optimizing queries for better performance and identifying root causes of application outages. I evaluated tools like Microsoft Excel, Splunk and AppDynamics for efficient log analysis, real-time monitoring and creating reports. With a technical leadership role as the Technical Head of the Open Source Community at Pune University, I showcased my collaborative skills and passion for innovation. Seeking new opportunities to apply my expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and programming, I am eager to contribute to organizations' success in the realm of Data Analytics and Data Science. <br /></p>
                                <p> SKILLS: Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Microsoft Excel, Pentaho ETL, React.js</p>
